# Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-Notes
- Contain Jupyter notebooks deriving, visualizing and understanding formulas found in Pattern Recognition by Bishop.
- **Caution**: LaTex sometimes does not render well in Jupyter notebooks and results in errors); for better formatting, download the notebooks and run them on your laptop. I have also __uploaded the PDF version__ of each notebook, in case you want to know how they look like when nicely rendered on my laptop.
- Error spotting and feedback are encouraged.
